- 👋 Hi, I’m @Marfoil
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new code languages, and developing some new skills
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript (mostly on node and react) and how to style websites
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any sort of website development (keep in mind I do it for fun so I cannot work on it as full time jobs)
- 📫 You can reach to me via email: xavimarfil@gmail.com
